Description: An easy-to-use, dependency-free set of functions for iterating over
    elements of various input objects. Functions are wrappers around base
    'apply'/'lapply'/'vapply' functions but designed to have similar
    functionality to the mapping functions in the 'purrr' package
    <https://purrr.tidyverse.org/>. Specifically, function names more explicitly
    communicate the expected class of the output and functions also allow for
    the convenient shortcut of '~ .x' instead of the more verbose
    'function(.x) .x'.
