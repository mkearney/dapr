In response to previous review, I made the following changes:

1. Changed the package title line in DESCRIPTION from 'Easy Apply Functions' to
'Purrr-Like Apply Functions Over Input Elements'
1. Added considerably to the description of functions and arguments especially
as it relates to the use of this package compared to base apply functions.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.2
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
